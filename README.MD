InfiniFill kiosks are self-contained autonomous cashless coffee kiosks, with a prepaid coffee  cup and smartphone app. Check out https://www.infinifill.squarespace.com for more details in the coming months.

This Git repo holds code for multiple CPUs that reside inside the InfiniFIll Kiosk. It's broken down into the following five directories (***JAVA_Code, PLC_Code, SPIN_Code, ARDUINO_Code, and CPP_Code***). We look forward to community support to help push beverage robotics to the next level.

***JAVA_Code: Highest level code which was designed to run on a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ and a Microsoft Surface Book 2016. Other platforms will be supported in the future or may work now with a little  hardware reconfiguration.

To run the code in JAVA_Code directory complete the following steps:
1. In a Linux or Windows Cygwin terminal, run the command "javac InfiniFill.java" to compile all JAVA code. @link https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7709041/javac-is-not-recognized-as-an-internal-or-external-command-operable-program-or 
2. Next run the command "java InfiniFill" to start kiosk software running.  
3. Enter input as prompted from the InfiniFillTerminal Class and have fun.
